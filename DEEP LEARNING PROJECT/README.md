## MOTION DETECTION

<p> Motion Detection is a process to detect the presence of any moving entity in an area
of interest. Motion Detection is of great importance due to its application invarious 
areas such as surveillance and security, smart homes, and health monitoring.
Today, surveillance cameras are used in all corners of our lives. The role of cameras
is not just surveillance. 
</br>
It also helps us to obtain interesting areas andgoals, and 
helps humans to better complete the expected work. In the field of machine vision, 
it has a very important role in target detection, recognition, positioning, tracking,
and navigation. 
</br>
In the object detection of human motion, a large number of scholars have studied
it, and many methods have been proposed to quickly and accurately find people in
video images. However, due to the increased requirements and various needs, the
goal of detecting people alone is not enough. In many scenarios, it is necessary to
perform motion recognition on the detected people. Therefore, the real-time and
accurate detection of the human body in the video image, and its positioning and
motion analysis, have an important role in real life. 
</br>
At present, human body motion recognition mainly includes methods based
on biomechanics, bioelectricity, and computer vision. </p>
